# BasicSnapshottesting
Creating basic snapshottesting for simpleview 
You can refer it for refresher

# Tech Stack
Used the package dependency from https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing
Used the next minor version for dependency rule
Used the Usage file from the avobe repo and added the Viewcontroller class 
Finally, added the assertSnapShot parameter- record: true
Then run and it will fail and add the new .png for test record for future reference
Now remove the record and run it will successfully pass!!
